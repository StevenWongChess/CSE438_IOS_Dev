//: # Studio 3: UITableView and Intermediate UIKit
//: ## CSE 438: Mobile Application Development
//: ### Overview
//: In this studio, you will look at some advanced concepts that you might use in a lab or your final project. We'll especially focus on UITableView and UICollectionView, which are important to understand for Lab 4.
//: ### Details
//: **Due:** End of class today. \
//: **Grading:** Complete as much of the studio as you can to get credit. \
//: **Submission:** Zip the file and submit it on Canvas under Studio 3.

 ## Reminder about QuickLook
 Remember that in a playground, you can use the `QuickLook` button to preview a `UIKit` element, and the `Show Result` button to keep the rendered element visible on the screen. Below, we create a UIButton, and then you can view it using QuickLook or `Show Result`.
 */
let button = UIButton()
button.setTitle("Click me!", for: .normal)
button.sizeToFit()
button.setTitleColor(.systemBlue, for: .normal)
button
/*:
 Since this lab primarily deals with UIKit, we will be using a lot of rendered UIKit elements.
 + callout(Creating a UIKit View): Let's practice by creating a UILabel, assigning it the text "Hello, world!", and making the text a color of your choice besides black. After you do that, use QuickLook to check that it works.
 */
let label:UILabel = UILabel()
// FIXME: Assign the text "Hello, world!" to the label
label.text = "Hello, world!"
// FIXME: Set the label's text color to something other than black
label.textColor = UIColor.green
label.sizeToFit() // resizes the label to fit the text, don't change this

 ## Tests
 Like in Studio 2, the bottom of the page will have a runTests call. If the tests pass, you will see all âœ…s. The order of the checks matches the order of tests on the page. Tests may be commented out, you must uncomment them before running.
